       <h1>Welcome to Anjola's Final Project Page!</h1>
      <p>
          Hi! This page is about the game I made for my CSC 106 Final Project.
       </p>
      <p>
        This is a trivia game called "Trivia World" made by me and my partner Molly. To play this game, click the start button and select your choice of the 4 options displayed. If your answer is correct, you get 5 points and get to move to the next question. If you pick the wrong answer, you lose 5 points. If you have 0 points and select the wrong answer, the game ends! Each question has a hint that is available to the user when they click the hint button. Users can score a maximum of 100 points.
